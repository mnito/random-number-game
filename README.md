# Random Number Game Example
Random Number Game implemented in Swift

I embarked on this small project to better my own knowledge of the Swift programming language. I posted it on here for the benefit of those just starting with Swift to use as an example.

The UI is a console application. Developed and tested on an Ubuntu VM.
